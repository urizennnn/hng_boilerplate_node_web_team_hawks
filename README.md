## Dependencies (Dev)

- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express
- ts-node-dev
- [Other dependencies]

## Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager, included with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Contribution Guide

## Getting Started

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```bash
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:this-is-you/first-contributions.git
```

where `this-is-you` is your GitHub username. Here you're copying the contents of the first-contributions repository on GitHub to your computer.

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```bash
cd first-contributions
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```bash
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```bash
git switch -c add-alonzo-church
```

### Make Changes

Make your changes to the codebase. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and guidelines.

### Run Tests

Run the existing tests to ensure your changes do not break anything. If you added new functionality, write corresponding tests.

```sh
npm run test
```

## commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```bash
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review into Staging

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon your changes will be merged into the staging branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/[app-name].git
cd [app-name]
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your environment-specific variables. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a reference.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit the `.env` file to match your environment configuration.

### 4. Compile TypeScript

Compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.

```sh
npm run build
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

Start the development server with the following command. This will also watch for any changes in your code and automatically restart the server.

```sh
npm run start:dev
```

### 6. Run the Production Server

To run the application in a production environment, use the following command:

```sh
npm run start
```

### 7. Verify the Setup

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/` to verify that the application is running correctly.
